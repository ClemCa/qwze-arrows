# qwze-arrows README

Have a keyboard you really like, but you're too used to AZERTY to switch to QWERTY?
This extension is for you!
It fixes the biggest issue with this setup: there is one less key on your keyboard.

## Features

'w' (or 'z' in qwerty) is the closest key to the azerty '<' & '>' key, apart from the shift key which expands above it.
It is also seldom repeated in programming or writing, and is hence the perfect key to use for our purpose.

- **Intuitive Arrow Typing**: Type 'ww' for a left arrow (<) and 'xx' for a right arrow (>), which will automatically convert to arrow symbols.
- **Easy Toggling**: Easily enable or disable arrow insertion with alt+w
- **W-only Mode**: You can also get even closer to the full AZERTY experience by using 'w' for both left and right arrows. This can be toggled with alt+x.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes to the following settings:

- `qwze-arrows.enabled`: Enable or disable arrow insertion. Enabled by default.
- `qwze-arrows.wOnly`: Use 'w' for both left and right arrows. Disabled by default.
